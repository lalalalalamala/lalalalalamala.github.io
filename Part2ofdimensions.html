    <h1>Hidden Dimensions introduction</h1>
    <h3>What is a hidden dimension?</h3>
    <p>A hidden dimension is an extra spatial dimension beyond the three we normally perceive (length, width, height) that exists in certain physical theories but is not directly visible or accessible in everyday life.</p>
    <p>We went through the hidden dimensions in the previous page. Now we are going to dive into theories that need extra dimensions and how these dimensions are used to prove theories:</p>
    <h3>1. Kaluza-Klein Theory (1920s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Unify gravity and electromagnetism</li>
      <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4D spacetime + 1 hidden spatial dimension (5 total)</li>
      <li><strong>Hidden dimension:</strong> Small circle, curled up so tiny (~Planck scale, 10⁻³³ cm)</li>
      <li><strong>Look/Description:</strong> If we lived on a “line,” the hidden dimension would be a tiny loop at every point, invisible at normal scales.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Names:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1-3-normal spatial (x, y, z)</li>
      <li>4-time (t)</li>
      <li>5-hidden circular spatial dimension</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Superstring Theory (1980s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Describe fundamental particles as tiny vibrating strings</li>
      <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9 spatial + 1 time (10 total)</li>
      <li><strong>Hidden dimensions:</strong> 6 extra spatial dimensions, compactified into very small, complex shapes called Calabi-Yau manifolds</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Look/Description and names:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1–3-length, width, height</li>
      <li>4-time</li>
      <li>5–10 hidden directions, curled up like a folded or twisted shape at each point in space</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are wondering about the names of the hidden dimensions. I have to tell you that they don't have names because of complexity. They’re labelled mathematically by coordinates on the compact space.</p>
    <p><strong>5–10 (hidden):</strong></p>
    <p>These are the six compact directions that form a Calabi–Yau manifold.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In equations, they’re often called <em>u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>, u<sub>3</sub>, u<sub>4</sub>, u<sub>5</sub>, u<sub>6</sub>, &theta;<sub>1</sub>, &theta;<sub>2</sub>, &theta;<sub>3</sub>, &theta;<sub>4</sub>, &theta;<sub>5</sub>, &theta;<sub>6</sub></em></li>
      <li>Each one is like a tiny circular or twisted direction.</li>
      <li>Together they make a 6-D shape (imagine a 6-D origami folded up at every point of our space).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. M-Theory (1990s)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Unify all string theories and include membranes (branes)</li>
      <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 10 spatial + 1 time (11 total)</li>
      <li><strong>Hidden dimensions:</strong> 7 extra spatial dimensions, curled up into very small, warped shapes (like multi-dimensional Calabi-Yau spaces)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Description/names:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1-3-length, width, height</li>
      <li>4-time</li>
      <li>5–11 (hidden): Even less like simple circles; more like a multidimensional origami with lots of folds and twists. The entire 7-D shape sits at every point of our ordinary 3-D space.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>5–11 (hidden): Seven compact spatial directions forming a 7-dimensional manifold.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Often denoted <em>u<sub>1</sub>.....u<sub>7</sub></em></li>
      <li>Mathematicians call these “<em>G<sub>2</sub></em>"</li>
      <li>They’re like a 7-D cousin of Calabi–Yau, even more complicated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These extra dimensions are needed for the theories to make sense and be mathematically possible</p>
    <p>The image below shows what M-Theory is made of. It consists of other theories that combine and unite. These united theories help us understand the world as one.</p>
