           Why: Without '#', the link points nowhere and breaks navigation functionality within the page. 
           Fix: Added '#' before 'home' to correctly reference the internal section ID. -->

           Why: Unclosed list items can cause list formatting to break and affect how styles are applied. 
           Fix: Added the missing closing </li> tag to properly terminate the list element. -->

<div id="content"> 
    <!-- Problem: The original structure did not properly close the #content container. 
         Why: Missing a closing </div> for #content causes the browser to misinterpret the layout and can make styling cascade incorrectly across sections. 
         Fix: Ensured #content wraps all main sections and added a proper closing </div> at the end. -->

<h1>Welcome to Alpaca Adventures</h1>
<p>Alpacas live in the mountains of Peru and are known for their soft wool and gentle personalities. They travel in groups called herds.</p>
</div> 
    <!-- Problem: The #home section was missing a closing </div>. 
         Why: Unclosed section elements cause improper nesting, leading to unpredictable rendering and layout errors. 
         Fix: Added a closing </div> to properly terminate the #home section. -->
<div id="wool" class="section dark"> 
<h2>Wonderful Wool</h2> 
<!-- Problem: The <h2> element was not closed in the original code. 
           Why: Leaving a heading unclosed merges following content into the heading context, breaking document semantics and accessibility. 
           Fix: Closed the <h2> tag to ensure proper heading structure. -->
<p>Alpaca wool is light, warm, and water-resistant. It's sheared every year to make cozy clothing.</p> 
 <!-- Problem: The text about alpaca wool was not wrapped inside a paragraph element. 
           Why: Without <p> tags, browsers may not apply proper spacing and semantic meaning, causing text alignment issues. 
           Fix: Enclosed the text in <p> tags for proper paragraph formatting. -->
<div class="wool-box">
<p>This box demonstrates <strong>absolute positioning</strong>.</p>
     <!-- Problem: The original HTML contained an extra opening <p> tag inside this section. 
             Why: Extra paragraph tags break valid HTML and can alter spacing or cause unexpected text flow. 
             Fix: Removed the unnecessary <p> tag to maintain valid structure. -->
<div class="wool-detail">
<p>I'm a smaller box positioned inside the larger one!</p>
     <!-- Problem: The original file had a closing </p> tag without a matching opening <p> tag. 
               Why: Unbalanced paragraph tags cause invalid markup and disrupt browser rendering flow inside this container. 
               Fix: Added a matching opening <p> tag to ensure valid paragraph structure. -->

<li>Alpacas can live up to 20 years.</li>
       <!-- Problem: The original code had an <li> tag missing its closing </li>. 
             Why: Without proper closure, list items merge into each other, causing layout inconsistency. 
             Fix: Added the missing closing </li> to complete the list structure. -->
<li>They rarely spit at people ‚Äî only other alpacas!</li>
<li>Each alpaca has a unique ‚Äúhum‚Äù sound.</li>
     <!-- Problem: The original code included an extra </li> closing tag after the final list item. 
             Why: Extra closing tags invalidate HTML and can cause list formatting errors.

       Why: Without this closing tag, the sidebar and footer might overlap or misalign due to broken layout hierarchy. 
       Fix: Added closing </div> to terminate the #content container properly. This comment already exists i am just showing where i added the closing </div> tag. -->
