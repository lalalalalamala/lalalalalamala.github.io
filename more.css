<h2>Wonderful Wool</h2> 
<!-- Problem: h2 might have been unclosed.

<p>Alpaca wool is light, warm, and water-resistant. It's sheared every year to make cozy clothing.</p> 
<!-- Problem: Text not wrapped in p tags. 
     Why: Browser might not apply proper spacing and paragraph styling.

<div class="wool-detail">
<p>I'm a smaller box positioned inside the larger one!</p>
<!-- Problem: There was a closing </p> tag without a matching opening <p> tag in the original code. 
     Why: Mismatched paragraph tags create invalid HTML, which can cause browsers to render the text incorrectly or break the layout inside the box. 
     Change: Added the opening <p> tag so the paragraph is properly enclosed. -->
