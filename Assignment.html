    <h1>Hidden Dimensions</h1>
    <p>Before we begin. What is a <em>dimension</em>?</p>
    <p>A dimension is just an <strong>independent direction</strong> you can move in, or an <strong>independent number</strong> you need to locate something.</p>
    <p>In everyday life, you need <strong>three numbers</strong> to say where you are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Length</li>
      <li>Width</li>
      <li>Height</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Time</strong> is usually counted as the <em>fourth dimension</em> in physics, because an event isn’t just “somewhere” but also happens at some moment.</p>
    <h3>How humans experience dimensions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We directly perceive <strong>3 spatial dimensions</strong>: forward/back, left/right, up/down.</li>
      <li>We sense time but not as a place we can move freely; we feel it flowing forward.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’s why people often say “we live in 3D + time.”</p>
    <h2>What shapes look like in different numbers of dimensions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0-D:</strong> A point (no size, just position).</li>
      <li><strong>1-D:</strong> A line (length only).</li>
      <li><strong>2-D:</strong> A square, circle, triangle,  and shapes with length and width but no depth.</li>
      <li><strong>3-D:</strong> Cube, sphere, pyramid, and what we’re used to: length, width, and depth.</li>
      <li><strong>4-D:</strong> You can imagine a “hypercube” (also called a tesseract). You can’t see it directly, but you can draw its shadow just like a cube’s shadow is a square.</li>
      <li><strong>n-D:</strong> In math, you can go on adding directions indefinitely. The shapes become higher-dimensional analogues (hyperspheres, hypercubes, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fact:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A 3-D object casts a 2-D shadow.</li>
      <li>A 4-D object would cast a 3-D “shadow” in our space.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is how physicists often picture extra dimensions.</p>
    <h4>This is how a square would look in higher dimensions:</h4>

    <p>This is a <small>cube</small>, or a square in the third dimension.</p>
