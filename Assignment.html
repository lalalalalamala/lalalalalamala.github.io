    <h1>Hidden Dimensions</h1>
    <P>Before we begin. What is a <em>dimention</em>?</P>
    <p>A dimension is just an <strong>independent direction</strong> you can move in, or an <strong>independent number</strong> you need to locate something.</p>
    <p>In everyday life, you need <strong>three numbers</strong> to say where you are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Length</li>
      <li>Width</li>
      <li>height</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Time</strong> is usually counted as the <em>fourth dimension</em> in physics, because an event isn’t just “somewhere” but also happens at some moment.</p>
    <h3>How humans experience dimensions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We directly perceive <strong>3 spatial dimensions</strong>: forward/back, left/right, up/down.</li>
      <li>We sense time but not as a place we can move freely; we feel it flowing forward.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’s why people often say “we live in 3D + time.”</p>
